## Landing

### Normal landing

Normal landing approaches can be made with power-on or power-off with any flap setting desired. Surface winds and air turbulence are usually the primary factors in determining the most comfortable approach speeds. Steep slips should be avoided with flap settings greater than 20째 due to a slight tendency for the elevator to oscillate under certain combinations of airspeed, sideslip angle, and center of gravity loadings.

**Note**: Carburetor heat should be applied prior to any significant reduction or closing of the throttle

Actual touchdown should be made with power-off and the main wheels first to reduce the landing speed and subsequent need for braking the landing roll. The nose wheel is lowered to the runway gently after the speed has diminished to avoid unnecessary nose gear loads. This procedure is especially important in rough or soft field landings.

### Short field landing

For a short field landing in smooth air conditions, make an approach at the minimum recommended airspeed with full flaps using enough power to control the glide path. (Slightly higher approach speeds should be used under turbulent air conditions.) After all approach obstacles are cleared progressively reduce power and maintain the approach speed by lowering the nose of the airplane. Touchdown should be made with power off and on the main wheels first. Immediately after touchdown, lower the nose wheel and apply heavy braking as required. For maximum brake effectiveness, retract the flaps, hold the control wheel full back, and apply maximum brake pressure without sliding the tires.

### Crosswind landing

When landing in a strong crosswind, use the minimum flap setting required for the field length. If flap settings greater than 20째 are used in sideslip with full rudder deflection, some elevator oscillation may be felt at normal approach speeds. However, this does not affect control of the airplane. Although the crab or combination method of drift correct may be used, the wing-low method gives best control. After touchdown, hold a straight course with the steerable nose wheel, and occasional braking if necessary.

The maximum allowable crosswind velocity is dependent upon pilot capability as well as aircraft limitations. With average pilot technique, direct crosswinds of 15 knots can be handled with safety.

### Balked landing

In a balked landing (go-around) climb, reduce the flap setting to 20째 immediately after full power is applied. If obstacles must be cleared during the go-around, reduce the wing flap setting to 10째 and maintain a safe airspeed until the obstacles are cleared. Above 3000 feet, lean the mixture to obtain maximum RPM. After clearing any obstacles, the flaps may be retracted as the airplane accelerates to the normal flaps-up climb speed.
