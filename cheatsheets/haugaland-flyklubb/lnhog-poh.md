# Takeoff

Prior to takeoff from fields above 3000 feet elevation, the mixture should be leaned to give maximum RPM in a full-throttle, static runup.

## Wing flap settings

Normal and short field takeoffs are performed with flaps up. Flap settings greater than 10° are not approved for takeoff.

Use of 10° flaps is reserved for takeoff from soft or rough fields. Use of 10° flaps allows safe use of approximately 5 KIAS lower takeoff speeds than with flaps up. The lower speeds result in shortening takeoff distances up to approximately 10%. However, this advantage is lost if flaps up speeds are used, or in high altitude takeoffs at maximum weight where climb performance would be marginal with 10° flaps. Therefore, use of 10° flaps is not recommended for takeoff over an obstacle at high altitude in hot weather.

## Short field takeoff

If an obstruction dictates the use of a steep climb angle, after liftoff accelerate to and climb out at an obstacle clearance speed of 59 KIAS with flaps retracted. This speed provides the best overall climb speed to clear obstacles when taking into account the turbulence often found near ground level. The takeoff performance data provided in Section 5 is based on the flaps up configuration.

If 10° flaps are used on soft or rough fields with obstacles ahead, it is normally preferable to leave them extended rather than retract them in the climb to the obstacle. With 10° flaps, use an obstacle clearance speed of 55 KIAS. As soon as the obstacle is cleared, the flaps may be retracted as the airplane accelerates to the normal flaps-up climb-out speed.

## Crosswind takeoff

Takeoffs into strong crosswinds normally are performed with the minimum flap setting necessary for the field length, to minimize the drift angle immediately after takeoff. With the ailerons partially deflected into the wind, the airplane is accelerated to a speed slightly higher than normal, then pulled of abruptly to prevent possible settling back to the runway while drifting. When clear of the ground, make a coordinated turn into the wind to correct for drift.

# Enroute climb

Normal climbs are performed with flaps up and full throttle and at speeds 5 to 10 knots higher than best rate-of-climb speeds for the best combination of performance, visibility and engine cooling. The mixture should be full rich below 3000 feet and may be leaned above 3000 feet for smoother operation or to obtain maximum RPM. For maximum rate of climb, use the best rate-of-climb speeds shown in the Rate-of-Climb chart in section 5. If an obstruction dictates the use of a steep climb angle, the best angle-of-climb speed should be used with flaps up and maximum power. Climbs at speeds lower than the best-rate-of-climb speed should be of short duration to improve engine cooling.

# Cruise

Normal crusing is performed between 55% and 75% power. The engine RPM and corresponding fuel consumption for various altitudes can be determined by using your Cessna Power Computer or the data in Section 5.

**Note**: Cruising should be done at 65% to 75% power until a total of 50 hours as accumulated or oil consumption has stabilized. This is to ensure proper seating of the rings and is applicable to new engines, and engines in service following cylinder replacement or top overhaul of one or more cylinders.

The Cruise Performance Table, below, illustrates the true airspeed and nautical miles per gallon during cruise for various altitudes and percent powers. This table should be used as a guide, along with the available winds aloft information, to determine the most favorable altitude and power setting for a given trip. The selection of cruise altitude on the basis of the most favorable wind conditions and the use of low power settings are significant factors that should be considered on every trip to reduce fuel consumption.

| Altitude  | 75% power            | 65% power            | 55% power            |
| --------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Sea Level | 114 KTAS - 13.5 NMPG | 107 KTAS - 14.8 NMPG | 100 KTAS - 16.1 NMPG |
| 4000 feet | 118 KTAS - 14.0 NMPG | 111 KTAS - 15.3 NMPG | 103 KTAS - 16.6 NMPG |
| 8000 feet | 122 KTAS - 14.5 NMPG | 115 KTAS - 15.8 NMPG | 106 KTAS - 17.1 NMPG |

To achieve the recommended lean mixture fuel consumption figures shown in Section 5, the mixture should be leaned until engine RPM peaks and drops 25-50 RPM. At lower powers it may be necessary to enrichen the mixture slightly to obtain smooth operation.

Should it be necessary to cruise at higher than 75% power, the mixture should not be leaned more than is required to provide peak RPM.

Carburetor ice, as evidenced by an unexplained drop in RPM, can be removed by application of full carburetor heat. Upon regaining the original RPM (with heat off), use the minimum amount of heat (by trial and error) to prevent ice from forming. Since the heated air causes a richer mixture, readjust the mixture setting when carburetor heat is to be used continuously in cruise flight.

The use of full carburetor heat is recommended during flight in heavy rain to avoid the possibility of engine stoppage due to excessive water ingestion or carburetor ice. The mixture setting should be readjusted for smoothest operation. Power changes should be made cautiously, followed by prompt adjustment of the mixture for smoothest operation.

# Landing

## Normal landing

Normal landing approaches can be made with power-on or power-off with any flap setting desired. Surface winds and air turbulence are usually the primary factors in determining the most comfortable approach speeds. Steep slips should be avoided with flap settings greater than 20° due to a slight tendency for the elevator to oscillate under certain combinations of airspeed, sideslip angle, and center of gravity loadings.

**Note**: Carburetor heat should be applied prior to any significant reduction or closing of the throttle

Actual touchdown should be made with power-off and the main wheels first to reduce the landing speed and subsequent need for braking the landing roll. The nose wheel is lowered to the runway gently after the speed has diminished to avoid unnecessary nose gear loads. This procedure is especially important in rough or soft field landings.

## Short field landing

For a short field landing in smooth air conditions, make an approach at the minimum recommended airspeed with full flaps using enough power to control the glide path. (Slightly higher approach speeds should be used under turbulent air conditions.) After all approach obstacles are cleared progressively reduce power and maintain the approach speed by lowering the nose of the airplane. Touchdown should be made with power off and on the main wheels first. Immediately after touchdown, lower the nose wheel and apply heavy braking as required. For maximum brake effectiveness, retract the flaps, hold the control wheel full back, and apply maximum brake pressure without sliding the tires.

## Crosswind landing

When landing in a strong crosswind, use the minimum flap setting required for the field length. If flap settings greater than 20° are used in sideslip with full rudder deflection, some elevator oscillation may be felt at normal approach speeds. However, this does not affect control of the airplane. Although the crab or combination method of drift correct may be used, the wing-low method gives best control. After touchdown, hold a straight course with the steerable nose wheel, and occasional braking if necessary.

The maximum allowable crosswind velocity is dependent upon pilot capability as well as aircraft limitations. With average pilot technique, direct crosswinds of 15 knots can be handled with safety.

## Balked landing

In a balked landing (go-around) climb, reduce the flap setting to 20° immediately after full power is applied. If obstacles must be cleared during the go-around, reduce the wing flap setting to 10° and maintain a safe airspeed until the obstacles are cleared. Above 3000 feet, lean the mixture to obtain maximum RPM. After clearing any obstacles, the flaps may be retracted as the airplane accelerates to the normal flaps-up climb speed.
